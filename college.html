                <h2 class="exp"> How I Ended Up In College In Ethiopia?</h2>
                <p class="story">I always had big dreams and Ethiopia was not one of them. At school, I was that kid that scored
                    the highest and worked the least. I did not work hard, I just figured out techniques to crack school
                    exams. I knew how to study and that's what got me past highschool and into college. However,
                    getting into the right college mattered to me, hence I disciplined myself into taking the SAT's and
                    going through the entire college application process. In a sudden turn of events, I ended up here in
                    Ethiopia. Taking a teenager from the luxuries of life right into it's penury doesn't usually end up
                    good, especially when they don't fit in. "Diaspora","Arab Ager" are things people label us with. I
                    disliked every moment of my stay here. I lived alone in the country during my first year, which
                    only made things worse. Not to mention, I was almost failing my studies. The techniques I used
                    back in high school don't work in college. What I learnt is that college is more than some grades
                    and a degree. How I see it, college mainly teaches you discipline, not hard work and not smart
                    work, but discipline. I am still trying to master the art of disciplining myself, but I believe I still
                    have a long way to go.

                    <h2 class="exp"> What I Think Of College?</h2>
                <p class="story">As much as I think anyone can learn what is taught in college, I believe college is important for
                    two main reasons. Number 1 : It's a transition stage from teenage life into adult life, from school
                    into work and from dependency into independency. Number 2: It's like a bed to fall back on. In
                    college, students take more risks exploring ideas and starting up a project since even if their projects
                    did not work they have that degree to look forward to. After college, everything gets serious, there
                    are bills to pay, food to buy etc. It's easier to stick to a riskless job which atleast pays the bill.</p>
                    <h2 class="exp"> Computer Science? What Is Wrong With You?</h2>
                    <p class="story">That is the question people ask when I tell them I chose this field. To be honest, I sometimes ask
                        myself the same question. Everyone including myself thought that I will join a law field or some
                        health field. I was good with dealing with computers but only the basic stuff. I remember when my
                        mom got us a computer tutor who could teach us some coding. That was a horror to me. On top of
                        him being Indian, he did not understand a single word of Arabic and he taught us as if we were some
                        coding experts. However bad of a coder I know myself to be, I joined this field with a goal and I am
                        not getting out of it until I achieve that goal, however long it takes. I don't actually understand how
                        people enjoy sitting for hours coding, but I don't enjoy it one bit. The only thing I like about it is that
                        things are possible in the world of technology which otherwise are not. For me, coding is more of a
                        tool I want to use to create what I imagine.</p><br><br>
