                <p class="story"> I lived in a country where you get paid for everything you do even more than what you deserve,
                    which people usually call it generosity. Volunteering was existent, but volunteering with no payment
                    was downright madness. Hence, when I came to Ethiopia, I was pretty shocked when I saw people
                    paying to volunteer. Volunteering as I saw it before was helping tourists get adjusted to the country,
                    providing snacks and giving directions to visitors of the Holy Mosques. Never did I think that by
                    volunteering I would actually help somebody's life become better even if just for a day. It gave such a
                    weird sense of inner satisfaction: helping people without expecting anything in return. People usually
                    tell me that they volunteer to give back to the community they lived in and then raise the question of
                    why I volunteer. I volunteer not with the sense of gratitude and the urge of giving back but with the
                    vision of making what is around me better. Although my class schedules usually clash with the time
                    I am supposed to volunteer, I try as much as I can to fit everything into my schedule.
