                <h2 class="exp">How I Started Reading?</h2>
                <p class="story"> Reading was an indisputable activity in our family. Right after we learnt how to read letters, we
                    were forced to read books even if we don't understand the content. My mom believed that real
                    education does not come from schools but from the minds and to nurture our minds we had to read.
                    She always said "The world has too many ignorant people with degrees, you will not be
                    added to that pool." Every summer vacation meant a bunch of books to read. It was a hectic activity
                    which neither me nor my siblings particularly enjoyed doing. As we grew up, our mother was rarely
                    present with us. At first, it was such a relief from all the readings that we were supposed to do. But
                    as time passed, we found joy in reading that we willingly started reading books more than we ever did.

                    <h2 class="exp">My Journey With Books</h2>
                <p class="story">Early on my teenage years, the books I read were pure anatomy. I was fascinated with how organisms
                    are created: their subtle anatomical differences yet their contrasting functionalities, so I decided to
                    become a scientist. With couple of years passing, my fascination was directed towards the galaxies.
                    I read books like 'A Short History Of Nearly Everything' (the part where it talks about the universe)
                    which shaped my dream of becoming an astranaut. Later on and upto this day, the books I read are
                    purely psychology and biography books which has nothing to do with the degree I'm pursuing. :)</p><br><br>
