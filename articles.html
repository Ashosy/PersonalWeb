                <p class="story">I have been a passive Quora user for quite a while, reading other peoples' theories and experiences. It was definitely a 
                    fun and rewarding experience without having to put myself on the spotlight. However, for a person who reads a 
                    lot, writing becomes an urging passion forcing its reader to share their view of the world. Hence, on the 
                    summer vacation of my freshman year of highschool, I wrote my first ever answer on Quora. The feedbacks,
                    replies and compliments I got only pushed me to write further and on a consistent basis.</p>

                <h2 class="exp">I document all my thoughts and feelings on my phone : Creepy?</h2>
                <p class="story">  In a world where nobody actually cares for other peoples' opinions especially that of younger ones, writing
                    has been my safe resort. I write whatever thoughts that come to my mind that are worth writing. From the silliest
                    'the world is unfair' thought to the complex 'How I imagine 2030 to be with technology and science battling
                    each other' thought, I write it all.

                <p class="story"> I always had big dreams and Ethiopia was not one of them. At school, I was that kid that scored the highest
                    and worked the least. I did not work hard, I just figured out techniques to crack school exams. I knew how to
                    study and that's what got me past highschool and into college. However, getting into the right college mattered to me,
                    hence I disciplined myself into taking the SAT's and going through the entire college application process. In a sudden
                    turn of events, I ended up here in Ethiopia. Taking a teenager from the luxuries of life right into it's penury doesn't
                    usually end up good, especially when they don't fit in. "Diaspora","Arab Ager" are things people label us with. I
                    disliked every moment of my stay here. I lived alone in the country during my first year, which only made things
                    worse. Not to mention, I was almost failing my studies. The techniques I used back in high school don't work in college.
                    What I learnt is that college is more than some grades and a degree. How I see it, college mainly teaches you discipline,
                    not hard work and not smart work, but discipline. I am still trying to master the art of disciplining myself, but I believe
                    I still have a long way to go.</p>

                <h2 class="exp"> What I Think Of College?</h2>
                <p class="story">As much as I think anyone can learn what is taught in college, I believe college is important for
                    two main reasons. Number 1 : It's a transition stage from teenage life into adult life, from school
                    into work and from dependency into independency. Number 2: It's like a bed to fall back on. In
                    college, students take more risks exploring ideas and starting up a project since even if their projects
                    did not work they have that degree to look forward to. After college, everything gets serious, there
                    are bills to pay, food to buy etc. It's easier to stick to a riskless job which atleast pays the bill.</p><br><br>
